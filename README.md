ABOUT EARTH
-1. Plate Tectonics Keep the Planet Comfortable:
Earth is the only planet in the Solar System with plate tectonics. Basically, the outer crust of the Earth is broken up into regions known as tectonic plates. These are floating on top of the magma interior of the Earth and can move against one another. When two plates collide, one plate will subduct (go underneath another), and where they pull apart, they will allow fresh crust to form.

About The Moon:
"Fly me to the moon, let me play among the star"
"let me see what spring is like, on Jupiter and marss"

Increased the Sun power:
-------------------------------------
function increaseSunPower(){
    let Sun = Sun.exe;
    let newSun = sun.increase(power);
    return newSun
}
increaseSunPower();
-------------------------------------

Increased the Sun heat:
------------------------------
function(){
    for(i=1;i>1 i++);
};
------------------------------
